# Digital QR Payment Analytics Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Digital QR Payment Analytics Project** repository!

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data lakehouse and analytics solution built on the Azure platform. It showcases an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that handles the complete data lifecycle: from ingesting raw QR payment transaction data into a data lake, through ETL processes for data standardization and cleansing, to loading business-ready data into a data warehouse that feeds interactive BI dashboards for daily business operations. The project also incorporates advanced machine learning capabilities for customer churn prediction and fraud detection.

Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in modern data engineering, analytics, and cloud architecture.

## Project Overview

This comprehensive analytics solution encompasses the following key components:

### 🏗️ 1. Data Architecture - Medallion Framework
- **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)**: Azure Storage Account storing raw QR payment transaction data in its original format
- **Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)**: Delta Lake on Azure Databricks providing ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and data versioning for cleaned and standardized data
- **Gold Layer (Business Data)**: Azure Synapse Analytics serving as the enterprise data warehouse with optimized fact and dimension tables for analytics

### ⚙️ 2. ETL Pipelines
- **Data Ingestion**: Automated extraction of QR payment data from source systems
- **Azure Databricks Processing**: Scalable data transformation handling high-volume transaction data using PySpark
- **Data Standardization**: Cleaning, validating, and enriching payment transaction data
- **Azure Synapse Integration**: Loading processed data into the data warehouse with optimized schemas
- **Orchestration**: Automated pipeline scheduling and monitoring

### 📊 3. Data Modeling
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Star schema design with fact tables for transactions and dimension tables for customers, merchants, and time
- **Data Quality Framework**: Implementing validation rules, consistency checks, and data lineage tracking
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexing strategies and partitioning for fast query performance
- **Business Logic**: Calculated fields and measures for key payment analytics metrics

### 📈 4. Analytics & Reporting
- **SQL Analytics**: Complex queries for payment trends, customer behavior, and merchant performance
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations showing transaction volumes, success rates, and revenue metrics
- **Business Intelligence**: KPI monitoring for payment processing efficiency and customer satisfaction
- **Automated Reporting**: Scheduled reports for stakeholders and operational teams

### 🤖 5. Machine Learning
- **Customer Churn Prediction**: ML models to identify customers likely to stop using QR payment services
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time anomaly detection models to flag suspicious transaction patterns
- **Transaction Success Optimization**: Predictive models to improve payment completion rates
- **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering analysis for targeted marketing and service improvements
